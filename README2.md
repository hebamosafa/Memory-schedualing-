# Memory-schedualing
This DeskTop Application is for vitualizing these schedualing methods:
- **FCFS** :
First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes
queued requests and processes in order of their arrival.
- **SJF** :
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution.
This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive.
  - Non-Preemptive:
  In non-preemptive scheduling, once the CPU cycle is allocated to process, the process holds it till it reaches a waiting state or terminated.
  - Preemptive:
  In Preemptive SJF Scheduling, jobs are put into the ready queue as they come. A process with shortest burst time begins execution. If a process with even a shorter burst time arrives,
  the current process is removed or preempted from execution, and the shorter job is allocated CPU cycle.
